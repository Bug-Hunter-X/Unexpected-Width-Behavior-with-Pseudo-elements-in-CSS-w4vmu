The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue.  The intention is to style elements with the class `container` to have a specific width, but due to an unexpected interaction, this rule might not work as intended in some scenarios:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.container::before {
  content: '';
  display: table;
}
```

The `::before` pseudo-element, while seemingly innocuous, can interfere with the `width` property of the parent element under certain conditions. The `display: table;` declaration can create a context where the width of the parent is affected by its content, rather than directly applying the specified width.
