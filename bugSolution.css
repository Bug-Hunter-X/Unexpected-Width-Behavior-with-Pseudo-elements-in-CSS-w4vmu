There are several ways to solve this problem.  One approach involves using a more appropriate display property for the pseudo-element:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.container::before {
  content: '';
  display: block; /* or inline-block, depending on the layout */
  height: 0;
  clear: both; /* If clearing floats is needed */
}
```

Another approach is to avoid the use of pseudo-elements altogether if their role is not essential to the functionality or visual presentation.  The specific solution will depend on the overall design.  For instance, if the pseudo-element is only used for clearing floats, you can solve the problem directly using other methods (like `overflow: hidden;` or `clear: both;` on a sibling element). Remember to ensure your CSS is well-structured, and use the browser's developer tools to diagnose unexpected behavior.
